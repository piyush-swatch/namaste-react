## JSX - introduced to make code less clumsy, looks syntactically similar to HTML but not HTML or XML
## JSX is not a valid JS and wont be understandable by JS engine, so JSX is transpiled by Parcel (using Babel) before catering to browser.

## Babel is a javscript compiler, responsible for converting JSX to ReactElement object.

## JSX doesnt have class, it has className attributes which gets transpiled to class.


## React Component are of two types :
    - Functional component (NEW)
    - Class based component (OLD)

##  Component composition : 
    - Using one react component inside another using <ABC /> tag

## Using javacsript statement in JSX
{} can be used inside JSX to use it as javascript statement
